<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Cube Surfing is developed with C# on Unity. It is a single player hyper-casual game.
 
The aim of the game is to keep our cube count high by collecting the cubes on the way and passing them through the right obstacles. My first goal for this game, which I made by cloning the Cube Surfer game, was to gain game cloning experience. After setting the main mechanics of the game, I wanted to add something extra myself.  

Here's what I did:
* More challenging and creative levels
* Different creative power ups
* Currently, there are 5 levels with different mechanics.
  
In addition, using Unity's cloud services, the materials we have in the game can be protected.
